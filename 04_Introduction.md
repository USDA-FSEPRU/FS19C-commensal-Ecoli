# Introduction

This is an attempt at writing the introduction for the project.

One therapeutic strategy to prevent pathogenesis is to outcompete pathogen for nutrients normally present in intestine and eliminate it before it can colonize and cause inflammation (reference #22: doi:10.1128/microbiolspec.MBP-0006-2014)

Some pathogens are more efficient at competing for nutrients and can thus outcompete native populations
