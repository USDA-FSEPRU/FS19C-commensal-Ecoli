# Notes, Ideas and Thoughts

# To do
## FS19C
* DRAM: run `DRAM.py distill` for remaining 213 commensal and STEC annotated genomes - need to compile all genomes' `annotations.tsv` into one `annotations.tsv`. Find out what pathways are present in all isolates.
* ppangolin: get fasta file of gene families or protein families, find out which ones are present/absent in STEC, commensals - blast those fasta files


## Ceres
* You can change your default Slurm account using running slurm-account-selector.sh on the login node.
  * To see all your Slurm accounts at any time, use “sacctmgr -Pns show user format=account”
