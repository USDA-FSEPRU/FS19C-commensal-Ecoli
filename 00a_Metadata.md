## Sample nomenclature key:
**(NovaSeqSequenceID#)-(Animal#)(RAMS or Fecal sample)(Time aka day negative #)(Isolate A/B/C/D)**

### NovaSeqSequenceID
* Number 1-96

### Animal'#'
* See FS19C_metadata.xlsx for animal # metadata

### RAMS or Fecal sample
* R = RAMS (collected from RAMS plates)
* F = fecal (collected from fecal plates)
* RE = RAMS-enriched (collected from RAMS-enriched plates)
* FE = fecal-enriched (collected from Fecal-enriched plates)

### Time aka day negative '#'
* N# = Day negative 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7 (see FS19 study for timeline)
  * N1
  * N2
  * N3
  * N5
  * N7
* Any sample names that don't have an N# were collected on day of necropsy

### Isolate A/B/C/D
* Isolate A/B/C/D: collected up to four separate colonies from one plate of (Animal#)(R/F/RE/FE)(Time aka day negative #)
