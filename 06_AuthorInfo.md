https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/authorship#loc-author-contributions

* **Conceptualization** -- Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.
* **Data Curation** --	Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later reuse.
* **Formal Analysis** --	Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.
* **Funding Acquisition** --	Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.
* **Investigation** --	Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.
* **Methodology**	-- Development or design of methodology; creation of models
* **Project Administration** -- Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.
* **Resources** --	Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.
* **Software** --	Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.
* **Supervision** --	Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.
* **Validation** --	Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.
* **Visualization** --	Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.
* **Writing –- Original Draft Preparation** -- Creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).
* **Writing –- Review & Editing** -- Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision – including pre- or post-publication stages.
